== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to import data from an xml file.*
** What it does: allows the user to add all entries from application data previously saved in an xml file.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it spares users the trouble of adding each entry one by one from data previously saved in a different file. This file could have been transferred from another computer.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires new classes to be created that are different from existing classes. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing classes.
** Credits: This enhancement makes uses and enhances existing code for reading data from an xml file written by previous developers.

* *Minor enhancement*: added an autosorting feature that allows the entries to be sorted by date/time every time a new entry is added.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B3/main/blob/master/collated/functional/karenfrilya97.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W13-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/karenfrilya97.md[Test code]]
